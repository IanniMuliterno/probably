\title{Create a class_pred vector from class probabilities}
\usage{
make_class_pred(.data, ..., levels, ordered = FALSE,
  min_prob = 1/length(levels))

two_class_pred(.data, ..., levels, threshold = 0.5, ordered = FALSE,
  buffer = 0, range = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame or tibble.}

\item{...}{One or more unquoted expressions separated by commas
to capture the columns of \code{.data} containing the class
probabilities. . You can treat variable names like they are
positions, so you can use expressions like x:y to select ranges
of variables or use selector functions to choose which columns.
For \code{make_class_pred}, the columns for all class probabilities
should be selected (in the same order as the \code{levels} object).
For \code{two_class_pred}, a vector of class probabilities should be
selected.}

\item{levels}{A character vector of class levels. For \code{make_class_pred}, the
length should be the same as the number of columns selected by \code{...}.}

\item{ordered}{A single logical to determine if the levels should be regarded
as ordered (in the order given).}

\item{min_prob}{A single numeric value. If any probabilities are less than
this value (by row), the row is marked as \emph{equivocal}.}

\item{threshold}{A single numeric value for the threshold to call a row to
be labeled as the first value of \code{levels}.}

\item{buffer}{A single numeric value for the buffer around \code{threshold} that
defines the equivocal zone (i.e., \code{threshold - buffer} to
\code{threshold + buffer}).}

\item{range}{A numeric vector of length two that explicitly defines the
equivocal zone.}
}
\value{
A vector of class \code{\link{class_pred}}.
}
\description{
These functions can be used to convert class probability estimates to
\code{class_pred} objects with an optional equivocal zone.
