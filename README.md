`probably` contains tools to facilitate activities such as:

 * exploration and visualization of class probability distributions,
 * conversion of probabilities to discrete class predictions,
 * investigate and estimate optimal probability thresholds,
 * inclusion of _equivocal zones_ where the probabilities are too uncertain to report a prediction, 
 * recalibration of class probabilities.
