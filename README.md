## Introduction

`probably` contains tools to facilitate activities such as:

  - exploration and visualization of class probability distributions,
  - conversion of probabilities to discrete class predictions,
  - investigate and estimate optimal probability thresholds,
  - inclusion of *equivocal zones* where the probabilities are too
    uncertain to report a prediction,
  - recalibration of class probabilities.

## Installation

You can install `probably` from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("topepo/probably")
```
